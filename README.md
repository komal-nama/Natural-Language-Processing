# ðŸ§  Natural Language Processing (NLP) Repository

This repository contains hands-on implementations of fundamental NLP techniques using Python and popular libraries such as **NLTK**, **SpaCy**, and **Gensim**.  
It serves as a learning resource for beginners to understand how text preprocessing and representation work in Natural Language Processing.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

### **Tokenization Example**
Splitting text into words and sentences.  
Implemented with `nltk.tokenize`.

### **Stemming**
Reducing words to their root form using algorithms like **Porter Stemmer** and **Snowball Stemmer**.

### **Lemmatization - Text Preprocessing**
Converting words to their base dictionary form using `WordNetLemmatizer`.

### **Stopwords with NLTK**
Removing common words (like *is*, *the*, *a*) to clean text data.

### **Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging**
Identifying nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc., using `nltk.pos_tag`.

### **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
Detecting entities such as names, locations, organizations, and dates.

### **Word Embeddings Techniques**
Understanding vector space representations of words.  
Covers concepts like **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**, and embeddings visualization.

### **Word2Vec - Practical Implementation**
Training and using Word2Vec for word similarity and analogy tasks.
